# INI2
Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.
Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a
and b.
```python
a =
b =
a ** 2 + b ** 2
```

# INI3
Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.
Return: The slice of this string from indices a
through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

```python
s = ""
a =
b =
c =
d =
print(s[a:b+1], s[c:d+1])
```

# INI4
Given: Two positive integers a and b (a<b<10000).
Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively.

```python
a =
b =

integer_list = list(range(a, b+1))

if (a % 2) == 0:
    odd_integers = integer_list[1::2]
else:
    odd_integers = integer_list[0::2]


odd_integer_sum = 0

for integer in odd_integers:
    odd_integer_sum = odd_integer_sum + integer

print(odd_integer_sum)
```
